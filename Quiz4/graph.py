"""
Class for representing undirected graphs.

A graph G is, conceptually, a pair G=(V, E)  
where
    V is a set of vertices.  Vertices must be comparable and immutable

    E is a set of edges, elements of E are pairs (u, v) where v, w are in V
    and the pair is ordered such that v < w

Note: this means no self loops, i.e an edge (v, v) from v back to itself.

    returns a list of sets, each set consisting of vertices.

    Each of the elements of C is a maximal size connected component of G.  
    A connected component of G is a set of vertices where any vertex in the
    component has a path to any other vertex in the component.  A maximal
    size component means that no other vertex can be connected to it.
    A vertex that is not connected to any other vertex is its own connected 
    component.

    NOTE: the list of sets C is ordered by the minimum vertex of each component
    For example, this list of connected components
        [{1, 3}, {0}, {5}, {4, 6}]
    would be sorted in C as:
        [{0}, {1, 3}, {4, 6}, {5}]

    Hint: Finding a spanning tree finds a maximal connected component.

    Hint: when a connected component has fewer vertices than there are in G
    there must be at least one other connected component.
