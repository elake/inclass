If using the VM:

open a terminal, make a working directory for today, eg
    mkdir 2013-02-05
download these files into your working directory
    bfs.py                  
    dfs.py
    display.py
    graph.py
    walk.py   
start xdot in the background:
    xdot &

finally, generate an animation of the random walk 
    python3 walk.py
and produce the file
    walk-graph.dot
and open this in xdot.  You will see the results of the walk.  

Now animate again, and this time you will see the step by step running
of the algorithm.

Ubuntu install:

If using your own Ubuntu VM, you need to install graphviz and xdot.  
But the xdot that the installer installs is not the one that monitors the 
file for update and re-renders.

After installing xdot, you want to download xdot/xdot.py, and do this command
    sudo cp xdot.py /usr/share/xdot

OSX:
    go to www.graphviz.org 
and download the version for your OSX.  To view the graph during animation,
use the graphviz application instead of xdot.
